The assignment operator is called when we assign one object to another preexisting object  e.g.

myList = yourList;

The copy constructor is called when we initialize one object using another e.g.

LinkedList myList = yourList;

The copy constructor is also called when an object is passed by value to a function or returned by value from a function.

In the case of LinkedList we need to overload both copy constructor and assignment operator. 
Otherwise the head pointer of the myList will point to the head of yourList.  
To avoid that we perform a deep copy, i.e. allocate new nodes for myList with the same data as yourList.  
Also, in the case of the assignment operator, we need to call clear to deallocate the existing nodes of myList.
